# Modelproject

Our Model Project concerns the Binominal Option Pricing Model which is widely used in financen to value options on stocks and other assets. The model was invented in 1979 by Cox, Ross and Rubinstein and our walk through of the model is inspired by the steps used in this wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_options_pricing_model

Step 1 concerns defining the binominal asset pricing model. In Step 2 we define the binominal option pricing model, while step 3 is pricing of the put and call option. 

To run our code start from the top and you should be fine.
